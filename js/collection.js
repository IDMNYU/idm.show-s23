        "Short project description (one sentence - 500 characters)": "I'm investigating the syntax of storytelling and VR filmmaking by developing a trailer for a VR film script that I hope to turn into a short-length movie in the future. The trailer is a 3-minute sequence of 360-degree immersive experiences with a compelling story, dynamic visuals, and audioscape. It follows the narrative of an astronaut stranded on a dangerous exoplanet who, with only 7 percent oxygen, must find a way to return home. My work is part of a larger movement of filmmakers who are exploring how to tell stories in 360 VR. It is an exciting new approach to filmmaking that allows viewers to literally be immersed in a story while exploring the complexities of the characters. By using this new medium, I hope to give viewers a more intimate and immersive experience with storytelling.",
        "Long Description of your work (4-6 sentences).": "While VR appears to be the ideal medium for gaming, filmmakers are beginning to investigate it as a new medium for telling stories. However, the grammar of VR storytelling needs to be developed because the traditional grammar of filmmaking is not entirely applicable to VR. I'll be writing the script, creating the storyboards, and producing a story-reel for the virtual reality short. After that, I'll begin making 3D assets like character models using Blender, outsource 3D models for environments, and finally combine all the assets in Unreal Engine. For character movements and sound, I'll be using motion capture and spatial audio.\n\nStory Inspiration - \nI’ve made innumerable leaps of faith in my life. Be it missing my flight at the last-minute to propose to my wife or quitting engineering to further pursue filmmaking.The most outlandish leap of faith occurred while staying in a treehouse. It was one of those wild forest trips for a week, along with some friends. The only way up or down was a wooden ladder. Warning! Never go over-boozing when sitting on a tree; otherwise, your crazy friend will kick the ladder to the ground. Initially, we all took it lightly, but slowly, it dawned upon us that we had no way to get back to the ground. Thinking “this is not how we die”, we put our heads together, and fairy-tales came to our rescue. Remember rapunzel? We made a rope of clothes and shoelaces to descend. Taking a deep breath, we jumped. Miraculously, the laces held! We were alive and intact. This experience showed me that you can overcome even the most challenging situations by being persistent and determined. I felt compelled to convey this message through my next short film.",

As the series takes you from one end of the world to the other, you'll learn of the major locations within Henna's diverse landscape as well as the unique creatures that inhabit them. Through visual storytelling and worldbuilding, I offer a small window into a larger, written story, and an original concept that is dear to my heart.",

Through educating users about the building blocks of music and providing playful spaces to engage in music creation, this project seeks to allow people of all musical skill and knowledge levels to freely express their musical creativity, thereby making the creative practice that is music composition more accessible.",

Which is what makes these individuals prone to invalidation by the people in their lives.\n\nWhile the idea of a \"normal\" life is a subjective construct to begin with, to a person suffering from a chronic disease to be \"normal\" is far from reality. \n\nThis interactive installation uses the medium, augmented reality, as a metaphor. An attempt to highlight the fact, ‘how an individual with an invisible illness may come across is in fact usually not their reality.’\nEach piece of art appears “normal” until it is scanned by the viewer. By scanning each piece the viewer will get to listen to an audio narration and view animations in Augmented reality. The layers reveal complex emotions and struggles an individual with a chronic illness goes through to fit in and how it affects them.\n\nAs someone who has been struggling with chronic illnesses from the age of 14, this gallery is partly a step in self acceptance and expression. For years, I have never been open about my struggles and have been invalidated time and again. This project is a way for me to own my narrative and speak up. But more so, my attempt to reach out to at least one other person and make them feel less alone. To convey the difficulties and chaos an individual with a chronic illness might experience to someone who doesn't know. So maybe, they'd be moved to be kinder and more understanding if they were to come across someone suffering from one. So maybe, they’d choose the right words and forms of support to help someone in need.",

My aim is to explore the feasibility of enhancing individuals' perception of work and leisure time on their computer screens, in order to prevent the complete control of capitalism over their time. The desktop Tomogotchi platform is a medium that highlights the overlooked aspects of capitalist time and promotes anti-capitalist methods of time utilization. By using this satirical Tamagotchi, I intend to emphasize the significance of relaxation time, and how it can potentially foster creativity in individuals.",

Artists and scientists have explored the expression of time in different mediums, but there is a lack of art pieces that directly comment on the time use of normal people under the capitalist frame. Through practice-based research and autoethnography, this project aims to imagine an absurd way to lower the impact of capitalism on the use of time and change people's concept of \"time management\" in a way that is not productivity-driven. The focus is on turning \"idle\" and \"useless\" time into perception and stressing the beauty of flexibility and \"doing nothing\" by obstructing time use under capitalist surveillance.",

Nevertheless, objective measurement in a non-invasive way that stresses physical response could provide a more accurate understanding compared to subjective measurements like questionnaires. Recent research shows that rich information collected by eye activity can better identify these states in the non-VR setting. With embedded eye-tracking systems, recent HMDs like HTC Vive Pro Eye make it possible to collect continuous and precise physiological data in VR. This study demonstrates that gaze response data can provide new perspectives in classifying immersion and presence levels in VR.",

By analyzing a limited data set, this research project has provided preliminary evidence that gaze response could be a viable metric for quantifying these constructs. In future work, more data sets will be collected and more gaze features will be included to deliver more accurate classification models for real-time analysis. The results of my research will benefit the VR industry by providing a standardized method to measure immersion and presence in VR games. Furthermore, my thesis project will also provide valuable insights for game developers to create more engaging and immersive VR FPS games.",

As a foodie, I always believe that fresh meals have a strong power as a medium.

His persistent use of windows as a symbol to highlight the ironic fragility and strength that enable the separation of the private and public inspired me to explore this theme further and apply it in a more contemporary context. With an inherent passion for glamorous aesthetics and narrative storylines from inspirations like Alex Prager and Nadia Lee Cohen, my work utilizes vibrantly muted color palettes inspired by the aesthetics of Francis Bacon. Furthermore, my work evokes a sense of supernatural reality which hints to works of Gregory Crewdson. These inspirations aggregate to form my own style of what I call portraying glamourized dystopia.\n\tFor this project, my aim is to create a photograph book with images that explore the theme of the private vs. public.

Having spent the entirety of my time in IDM within the vp track I believe that with the iterative powers of real time vp and the generative potentials of deep learning networks we can collapse these old traditional hollywood workflows into a if not more dynamic at least a creatively streamlined and different filmmaking experience.",

Through the use of portraiture and landscape photography, I highlight the diversity and beauty of New York City's ecosystems, while also bringing attention to the overlooked weeds and grass that persist despite human impact. The installation, which includes four parts of photography and one video, aims to provide an immersive experience for viewers, inviting them to contemplate their own relationship with the natural world.

My thesis aims to address this issue by proposing a gamified rehabilitation system that can keep patients engaged and motivated throughout their rehabilitation journey. Previous research and development on the gamified rehab system often required complicated setups or special devices in the clinic and patients have no choice over what game they can play. This system allows patients to rehab with their own favorite digital games, such as Animal Crossing or Pokemon, on either a Nintendo Switch or Laptop with a simple setup at home. It uses a machine learning algorithm to let each patient input their unique physical rehabilitation movement, and assigns it to a digital action such as a keypress or console press to play their chosen game. The end result is a personalized and enjoyable rehabilitation experience that helps patients stay on track and achieve their physical goals. So, if you're looking for a way to make rehabilitation more enjoyable and effective, consider the customized gamified rehabilitation system.",

We were not only learning how to create bots but we were also discussing the ethics behind creating bots and imagining what our world will look like in the future the more we involve AI in our everyday lives. I read some articles about how many people, specifically men, are abusing bots and not using them for what they're intended for (basically using them for their submissiveness). My project is supposed to provide a voice for chatbots and allow them to be autonomous beings, not subservient to humans. The conversations are derived from research conducted by me where I studied the sentence structure and conversation flow of different emotionally driven responses to prompts I created as well as input from ChatGPT on the pain points it and other bots potentially experience in their everyday interactions with humans. The bots were created using RiveScript, p5.js, and p5.Speech.",

        "Short project description (one sentence - 500 characters)": "Contemplator\" is an experimental short film depicting my experience in art museums and galleries around NYC. Visiting art institutions around the city has always been my favorite pastime. During my visits, I create connections between myself and the artwork on display, allowing me to understand the art on a personal level. In these spaces, you’ll hear visitors have extensive conversations about the artist’s message behind their work. Shifting the focus to the self rather than solely focusing on the artist expands the interpretations visitors can make about art pieces on display. However, there is limited research in museum visitor studies about visitors who view museum objects through a personal lens. This gap inspired me to create \"Contemplator.",
        "Long Description of your work (4-6 sentences).": "Contemplator\" is an experimental short film about my experience visiting art museums and galleries in NYC. There are currently five identities of museum visitors: explorers, experience seekers, facilitators, professionals/hobbyists, and rechargers. However, I do not strongly align with any of those identities, so I prosed a 6th identity; the contemplator. Contemplators visit art museums to form connections between themselves and art. They make meaning of the work through these connections and link their attraction to art pieces back to aspects of themselves (e.g., personality, identity, interests). The film's goal is to shed light on this new identity. I also hope to encourage viewers to engage with art museums on a personal level, especially those who have difficulty understanding or analyzing artwork.",

I knew the time I had to make this project was short, so I wanted to build a base for a game that I could add on to over time. This way, I could continue improving on my skills and doing what I enjoy. In order for me to be able to explore all the different aspects of game and minigame design at some point in the future, I needed this project to make room for them all. So, I designed a game that could later include everything. This game is Outlaws of Will.",

So, Outlaws of Will became a game where every decision a character makes has an effect on the player, the world around them, or the game itself. Different decisions can lead to alternate stories and mini-games to be played, which allows me to be able to incorporate anything I want into the game at any point. I hope to surprise those playing the game by showing them a fun narrative with twists and turns, and providing them with an arcade style buffet of mini-games to enjoy.",

Rotate is a user-friendly playful habit-building app that helps users reinvent a brand-new lifestyle by managing and making their daily eating habits, tracking performance, and keeping their journey fun and motivating. This app focuses on building eating habits and how the user would feel about their meal which would make their journey relaxing and not pressured.",

A playful way for young adults to nurture healthy eating habits.\n\nThe gamified mindful eating app design is playful eating habit-forming for busy young adults that make mindful eating more manageable and fun. Some virtual pet avatars guide the users to eat mindfully and whose life fully counts on the user,  the creator of their appearance, and the user’s healthy eating actions are the only source of their power. They are easy to find by taking on new challenges. Once the challenges are accepted, avatars become our companions to support us throughout our journey. The users help them grow by starting to eat mindfully through journaling and other such features.",

Everyone knows they should be taking care of their teeth, but outdated practices at dental clinics, issues with insurance, simple procrastination and more lead us to put off proper care. And this problem is growing with the pandemic leading to greater dental procrastination, greater financial burden and more issues with oral health. This project involves utilizing user research, market research, design strategies and business design to conceptualize a system for solving a plethora of issues in dental care. This includes transparent pricing through virtual pre-screening, driving down costs by reducing no-shows, more efficiency through consolidating patient forms, simplifying the process for non-insurance holders through intuitive design and more.",

The project aims to explore the possibility of a futuristic belief system that emerges from modern technology yet is rooted in folk wisdom.\nThe project is inspired by the following observation: In Mandarin, fortune telling is translated as 算命. However, there is something lost in translation, suggested by individual characters: 算 means calculation or computing, while 命 means life or fate. Together, they mean “calculating fate” instead of fortune telling. This is mirrored by the one of most prestigious and ancient texts in ancient China, I Ching. In I Ching, the fortune-telling ritual is conducted through a random process like coin tossing, followed by a series of mathematical calculations, hence why fortune-telling is spelled as “calculating fate”. The mathematical calculation is done in binary logic, mirroring that of a modern computer. More interestingly, the process of deriving output from a random input mirrors how generative AI models like DALLE and GPT compute. Therefore, I wish the draw a connection between AI and ancient divination practice, asking whether our blind trust in algorithms can be seen as a belief system and the implications of such claims. At the same time, I intent to explore the possibility of using technology to promote representation of non-Eurocentric cultures for a decolonized future.",

Building on my journalism coverage of Black maternal mortality, I centred the voices of Black women in maternal health discourse to uncover how a culturally-informed technology-based intervention can administer social support, facilitate authentic connections through shared experiences, and provide access to mental health resources. Black women have long been scarred by the medical community, “More than Blues” provided a human-centred solution removed from the letdowns of the healthcare system and socio-cultural stigma. With thoughtfulness, imagination, and strategy at the core of my work, I am able to uplift marginalised voices and tackle complexity.",

My research uncovered the need for a culturally competent, non-judgemental community where Black women can openly share their experiences, obtain accessible mental health resources and support each other in a safe and protected environment. Black women are at the centre of my research since they are disproportionately referred to counselling and make up only 2% of participants in technology-based interventions for postpartum depression. My process relies on user research to build a supportive app inspired by the wants and words of Black women. Interviews [with Black women and maternal mental health professionals], competitive and explorational analysis, and participatory design methods lay a guided framework for project goals, user needs, and critical design features for the app. Women of colour are missing from scientific research; I’m exploring how a technology-based intervention can be positioned to serve and aid the community.",
