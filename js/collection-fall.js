        "Gameplay as a method of education has long been studied; indeed, NYU even has a Games for Learning Department.  Gameplay has begun to be studied as it relates to students learning about the environment.  My thesis project compares the absorption and retention of facts related to Climate Change by studying participants who read to an article on the subject and comparing them to another group of participants who are exposed to the subject via playing cards, through images and captions.  The facts are exactly the same because I took care to do so as I wrote the article, as suggested by my thesis teacher Prof. Nathanson, and created the playing card game prototype, again, suggested by Prof. Nathanson, thereby creating a more standardized comparison of the two media.  The game prototype, which is currently called Climate Change Rearrange, has undergone several iterations as the cards were tested, and the players' critiques, as well as faculty and fellow student suggestions, were incorporated, particularly in the area play itself.  The game had to be FUN!",

        "Taichi, a traditional Chinese sport with a long history and a wealth of cultural meanings, has a glorious past and was formerly practiced by hundreds of millions of people throughout China. Due to the fact that taichi is a gentler and slower style of boxing than other fighting martial arts, it does not appeal to young people's desire for excitement, confrontation, and skill, and has become unpopular and even somewhat rejected among the young. However, because Taichi is based on the traditional Chinese medical concepts of Qi, Yin, and Yang, and the Five Elements, this sport not only addresses the subhealth problems associated with modern youth, such as stress and an irregular lifestyle but also allows for complete relaxation of the spirit, so it is a great pity that Taichi is so neglected by young people. Thus, I would like to create a virtual reality interactive Taichi game, reviving the ancient Taichi exercise on a modern platform. This project will be developing a method in the virtual world that allows players to experience Taichi, applying how high-tech techniques to a traditional civilization from the past so that players can immerse themselves in Taichi, learn it more easily, and feel the sport's rhythm and connotation more fully.",

        "Electric vehicles (EV) pose an immediate threat to the safety of pedestrians. The absence of a traditional internal combustion engine in an electric vehicles causes them to produce no sound when travelling at speed lower than 18.6 mph (30 km/h). Pedestrians often rely on these traditional engine sounds to warn themselves of any incoming vehicle. To solve this problem, my thesis proposes different external warning sounds for EVs to alert pedestrians including users with visual and auditory disabilities.",

        "This project is inspired by anti-vaccination protests that have been seen over the news since the COVID-19 vaccines were first announced. Studies have shown that the main reason people are hesitant to take vaccines is due to their lack of trust in either institutions, government, or medical authorities. People trust their lives to medical professionals in case of any medical emergency, but why is that not the case with the COVID-19 vaccine? The information people consume plays a significant part of what they believe in. This project explores the hesitancy related to vaccines and how the information people receive is enough to induce vaccine doubts towards the COVID-19 vaccine. A prototype was developed with the purpose of trying to make anti-vaxxers think about the issue of vaccination hesitancy and its impact.",

        "My thesis project aims to explore how might we create a better remote onboarding experience for junior employees. The solution is to create an internal mobile application and desktop that support new hires at various points in an onboarding process within an organization. The stakeholders are companies that don’t have the administrative resources to develop an established onboarding program. \n\nThe thesis project derived from the question “how to facilitate employees' creative innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The project uses the Research for Art & Or Design approach to investigate the nature of creative innovation of large technology companies and understand its relationship with workplace culture, environment, artifacts, and other factors. \n\nI leveraged persona-based scenario mapping to illustrate how the product helps the user. Jill Chan, 26 years old, single, based in mountain view, California, will serve as my primary user. She is organized, empathetic, curious, hardworking, passionate, and punctual. She has a Bachelor's degree in Human-Centered Design & Engineering and recently received an offer from a Fortune 500 software company as a product designer. She's excited to begin her first full-time job in a couple of months but nervous because she doesn't know what to expect, especially in a remote work environment amidst the pandemic.\n\nThe feature sets were designed to include 30% core features, 20% quality of life, and 50% future updates. While the mobile application and desktop are both designed for a better onboarding process, they serve different roles for the user. The mobile application greets the user, sends updates for immediate actions, and keeps track of the user's progress. At the same time, the website is a place to set definitive goals and find more detailed content. The features designed as the quality of life are playful elements such as a reward system to encourage more active use of the product. The following updates will include a suggestion board to request new extensions and role-based classes.",

        "The New York City subway system is notorious for its frequent delays and service changes. So how can we make riding the subway easier for everyone without tearing everything down? Navigating the Maze is a project that explores the commuting experience and addresses the wayfinding problems in busy New York City subway stations through analyses and observations of information systems, media surfaces, and commuter behavior. The study is based on two stations – 14th St-Union Sq and Jay St-MetroTech, as they serve as major transit hubs in lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. Research methods such as observations, behavioral mapping, and interviews were used to discover the experience navigating through these stations.\nThis project illustrates the ways in which both stations could benefit from having a more contextualized information system and better placements of informational infrastructures. Passengers would be able to make more informed wayfinding decisions and be less likely to be confused, frustrated, or overwhelmed throughout their journey.",

The result of my research is  a party service design that can welcome people — regardless of their identity or level of familiarity — into Chinese New Year celebrations and rituals. I encourage people to explore how their own personal identities have uniquely shaped their cultural celebrations, educate my audience about Chinese New Year rituals, and hope to inspire my audience to imagine how we might engage with both new and familiar rituals. To accompany this party service design there will be an illustrated autoethnographic zine, a ritual & customs card set, and a cultural reflection guestbook.",

In Petco and other pet supply stores, I see a lot of dog products but very few cat supplies. Furthermore, cat garments for Sphynx, Devon Rex, and Cornish Rex cats come in restricted patterns, and fitting flaws are more common in the western market. So I began thinking of developing a cat lifestyle brand, starting with cat breed-specific clothes. So I began to consider creating a cat lifestyle brand, starting with clothing for specific cat breeds. I have a background in fashion design, so it's easier for me to begin with something I'm acquainted with. According to my research, Sphynx, Devon Rex, and Cornish Rex cats only have one layer of fur or no fur at all; hence they must wear clothing when the temperature drops below 68 degrees Fahrenheit. This brand aims to create compelling designs from the perspective of cats while maintaining human aesthetics.",

This app, 2Score, is designed to assist 35 to 65 year olds with building good practice habits. The app takes advantage of the psychology behind a person’s desire to maintain a streak in order to build a habit.  The app tracks musical playing progress, allows the user to internally reflect on their practice through reflection entries and thus, users can see their progress over long periods of time.",

        'People sometimes experience the sentiment of “being moved”, also known as "kandoh" in Japanese, when viewing art, listening to music, or playing a video game.  My goal is to create a VR experience where people can experience kandoh through 3 particular sentiments and ideas which we don’t have direct translations for in English: "saudade", "fernweh", and "mono no aware". After the loss of my grandmother in December 2021, I felt closer to these ideas than ever. Featuring audio clips of my family members, this project serves to describe who my grandmother was, in a fully immersive experience. Not only will players find memories of my grandmother as they peacefully explore the VR environments, but my hope is for them to think back with empathy, nostalgia, and appreciation about their own lives and loved ones of the past, present, and future.',

I’m also cautiously curious about the psilocybin mushrooms’ potential to heal depression on a deeper level. \n\nI believe that everything we want and need is either already inside us or can be achieved by practice; yoga and meditation are my ways to walk the life path, and the psilocybin mushroom is a very promising tool to illuminate the right pathway we walk towards. \n\nHealing is a life-long journey and Art making is a healing journey within itself.

        "“ABC” is a visual essay that documents a reflection of my own journey with navigating my cultural identity as a Chinese-American, from a rigid, black and white conception of Chinese vs American identity to a more fluid and dynamic conception of both. The essay documents a brief history of Chinese typography in America alongside a series of kinetic typography experiments. Stereotypes, even seemingly small and harmless ones like those built through typographic elements, build an inaccurate view of the ethnic group they are meant to represent. Although increasingly violent and more prominent in these recent years, racism towards Asian people based on these stereotypic and shallow representations is not new! Typography is just one way that history has shown this. “ABC” tries to show how typographic representation can be bilingual and increasingly diversified, and encourages the viewer to think about the connotations of “ethnic” type.",

        "Being brought up in a quintessential traditional Asian family, we typically do not converse about our emotional issues as it is considered taboo, weakness, and shame that let down the entire community. This cultural pressure silences us and eventually develops into a generational trauma, which is the reason why according to many scientific studies, Asians are the least among other populations to seek help when it comes to mental health. In addressing this matter, I believe it is necessary to configure a step prior to professional psychotherapy as for some of us, the concept is rather foreign and intimidating. In light of breaking this mental health stigma, Mind Sauna is designed in the form of a portable headgear aiming to provide a momentary safe space for the mind to be vulnerable. This 10-minutes long curated meditative experience consists of an interior illuminated skylight with hues subtly changing sequentially, along with an integrated earpiece playing a compilation of other people’s stories on their mental health journeys that allows users to connect emotionally and realize that they are not alone with their problems. The whole experience is hoped to become a source of encouragement where one can find a sense of belonging in the midst of their beautiful mess and be more open-minded towards the practice of psychotherapy in the future.",

        "Neverisland is a healing/entertaining interactive experience that raises an adult's happiness based on the Mixed Reality immersive environment by integrating the natural environment and nostalgia components. \nThe motivation for my thesis is my personal experience with mental stress caused by Covid-19 and a more broad aspect related to the global mental severe health issue among adults. In recent years, the impact of chronic stress on mental disorders has become the subject of many studies.  Emotional pressure has become a high-frequency word used in modern society. It is an unavoidable psychological state that everyone is facing. In particular, the global pandemic has exacerbated people's psychological pressure in the past two years. The outbreak of COVID-19 has seriously affected many aspects of people's daily life. Coronavirus not only attacks our bodies but also affects people's mental health in many ways. Therefore, I desire to make an entertaining interactive experience to help more people like me who are under stress to relieve themselves by combining nature and nostalgia aspects.\n           This world is set on floating islands with a low poly style. Experiencers can choose to land on any island to experience different interactive stages. For each island’s experience content, I include these nostalgia factors that can evoke nostalgic memories in most people globally and the natural environment and let players interact with and have many kinds of experiences.\n          This project is developed in Unreal with Magicleap Glasses using Mixed Reality technology. Users can experience and interact with Neverisland in their familiar physical space instead of a completely virtual environment. By comprehensively blending both physical and digital realities, MR is able to build new levels of engagement and immersiveness.",

But over the years of working and narrowly avoiding living out of my car as I established my career, I realized that there was so much more to discover and unpack within myself. \n\nThis is an interactive non-fiction novella meant to push the boundaries of the types of stories we tell in multiform literature. It's for anyone who is struggling to escape toxic situations and establish their lives, their careers, and their future hopes.\n\nMechanically, it is an interactive non-fiction novella that harnesses kinetic typography and simple visual elements to enhance the message. It plays on traditional tactics of interactive fiction like decision-making by presenting difficult real-life situations where choice is only an illusion.",

        "What does it mean, nowadays, to claim to be a cyborg? Taking Donna Haraway’s cyberfeminist theories as a point of departure, I seek to interrogate the cyborg myth at our current technoscience-power nexus not on a rather/than premise, but to deconstruct this epistemological dichotomy from a more Marxist-socialist perspective with respect to vernacular stories told by Women of Color, more specifically, Chinese women. Here, I offer some preliminary and speculative thoughts on how I intend to better articulate my own construct of a cyborg identity by analyzing the dynamics between politics of gender, body, and other identity markers entangled in the combined fields of social constructivism, technology, and aesthetic practices in fashion design. In an effort to re-appropriate aesthetic norms with wearable technology and virtual reality, this thesis project is a refashioned head-mounted device to help destabilize systemic patriarchal control over the female body and to regenerate power and autonomy on a more fluid panorama of non-binary realities.",

I use the tasty app and spotify a lot, and I really like both, so I thought, why not combine two things that I love & use all the time?

        "The topic for this project came from my interests in fashion history, interior design, and material culture, and I wanted to find a way to celebrate craft traditions and inform people about the art and labor that went into producing textiles before the Industrial Revolution. To do that, I decided to apply the technical, digital skills I’ve learned at IDM and create a visually-focused, exploratory website concept that bridged the gap between an information database and a museum exhibition.  By laying out all of the swatches on a single page, I want visitors to feel excited and encouraged to begin clicking, learning, and enjoying the stimulation that materials and patterns can bring to the senses, even in a digital format. To encourage that immersive feeling, I designed the site itself to emulate a swatch book, which tailors and dressmakers would bring to clients throughout the 15th-18th centuries so that they could order garments and furniture in their desired fabrics. This project brings together what I love about physical items and workmanship with what I’ve learned at NYU regarding formal design and creating online experiences.",

Although I feel drawn to enter the space, there are many things that keep me hesitant; primarily the difficulty of keeping up with a world that's rapidly growing and constantly shifting, with different conversations/controversies surrounding it. Both fascinated and skeptical, I want to explore the various reactions to NFTs, mainly based on my personal experience and observations but also informed by a deep dive into numerous sources discussing the topic. Imitating a popular NFT trend, I’ve created a (hypothetical) character collection with five distinct characters that each represent a specific (generalized) reaction. Through comical dialogue, I want to encourage the audience to pause and reflect seriously about a potentially revolutionary innovation.",

I decided to tackle this great woe of our generation by building a chrome extension that helps users stay afloat in the hecticity of their everyday by providing them with a sanctuary in their New Tab page where they can stay organized, motivated, and sane, with light-hearted aesthetics, daily inspirational quotes, and built-in task management tools. I was inspired by existing extensions such as Momentum to transform the standard New Tab page into something that is visually pleasing and useful.

        "As of this year, I’ve been starting to run a couple of times a week with my friend, and I really wanted to focus on getting a consistent pace going for longer runs. I often struggle with either going too fast at the start and tiring out or going too slow and not pushing myself hard enough, leaving a lot of energy at the end of my run. Something else I struggle with is having good, high-energy playlists that match the cadence I’m trying to run at. I often have a good playlist that I can run for a week with, but then I get tired of it and focus less on the music and more on how tired I am. It’s hard to create unique playlists each week, especially one that matches the tempo and energy I need.\n\nSo, I had the idea to automate it using the Spotify API, and that’s where this senior project came from. I looked into the API and they had all the data I needed - BPM, genre, and energy level of the song.",

        "The idea for this project came from my intersecting interests in UX design, designing for accessibility, and reading. After taking the Disability Studies course this semester, I was able to connect and build relationships with the disabled community. Through these connections, I was able to gain insights into some of the challenges the community faces in interacting with technology. Their enthusiasm to learn was often hindered by the lack of accessible design. I decided to create a mobile app experience that allows users with various disabilities to easily read the news and articles related to their interests. For my project, I applied the user research, visual design, and prototyping skills that I have learned at IDM to build a mobile app prototype. I went through all stages of the design process from conducting user research to designing low fidelity prototypes to running user testing sessions and finally building the high fidelity prototype in Figma. \n\nMy goal for building this app was to help users with various disabilities feel able and included in the community. I hope that they can easily navigate through various articles related to their interests and passions to make learning an enjoyable process! \n\nThis project brings together my passions for designing for social good and creating inclusive experiences. I believe that accessibility is the foundation for design and I hope that this project takes us one step closer to a more inclusive digital world.",

We will humorously dive into their 12 year old’s bat \nmitzvah and highlight all things meaningful, shallow, material and awkward. In comparing their 12 year old bat mitzvah to the bat mitzvah they would design for their current self, we will discuss how the Jewish community they grew up in shaped their values, sensibilities, and religiosity.

With the help of fellow language learners from the American Swedish Institute, I gathered myriad sound bite recordings of each vowel– These recordings were later used to train my custom machine-learning model that evaluates the player’s pronunciation as successful or otherwise. I believe that this project has the potential to expand to include both more of the Swedish language as well as any other language people are interested in practicing, and I hope that it inspires people to keep learning past traditional classroom settings.",

Spotify itself only really lets you save albums and songs and make playlists, so it's hard to keep a definitive list of all the music you like, and even harder to categorize it. I wanted to make a website that makes it easier for people to keep track of their music, where all they have to do is rate/tag/journal an album and its tracks, and move on to the next one. When you sign up and log in, you're asked to sign into your Spotify, and then Qtracks pulls up music that you've listened to and lets you start rating and tagging. Then you can look at all your music and eventually you'll be able to filter your music so you can more easily find what you're looking for. It's a personal website where you get to explore your relationship with the music you love.",

        "This project is about redesigning the MTA eTix application to better fit customer needs, create a more sustainable approach to the MTA ticket system, and make a more aesthetically pleasing, accessible, user friendly interface. I want the people of NYC to have a simple, easy, non-stressful way to find, purchase, and us tickets (without having to stop to use their card to refill a paper Metrocard or without having to purchase a physical LIRR ticket). With the new MTA eTix, users can simply install the app, turn on their location service, choose an origin and destination, and allow the app to map a route based on efficiency. Users handle all purchases through the app! They don’t have to worry about waiting in lines, losing their cards (or wasting paper), or handling their credit cards in public, potentially unsafe places.",

I want to make this project to highlight the importance of storytelling and how important it is to preserve the stories that are passed down the family tree and across the tree to acquaintances. It will be a live design website made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript hosted on a public server, and it will have a homepage with a building and individual buttons with different characters that users can click on. Each character prompts the user to have a conversation with them so that they can relay their individual stories. Once the user exits the building, they can read and add their own anonymous story to the story board, which will be like a Pinterest board style archive of their personal narratives.",

        "Social media should be seen as a new iteration of the “commons” an open communal space where people can interact with one another. My project focus on how Users themselves can interact with social media in ways that are more therapeutic and less exploitative. In a 2019 interview with Oprah, writer Toni Morrison said “Everybody Needs A Place That Is Theirs” social media offers users the ability to curate their very own safe spaces, but due to the nature of social media algorithms this curation has to be done critically and intentionally by users themselves. Our content needs to be therapeutic in order to combat the daily oppressive forces that we face in society, social media can be a washer machine for our individual and collective psyches but we have to make it that way. Your social media is a museum of you, what exhibition are you curating and what exhibitions are you attending?",

For my senior project, I designed Ride, a ride-hailing mobile app that compares available accessible transportation methods for wheelchair users.

The destigmatization of mental health and better access to treatment is a rising platform in the US overall, but Asian American communities are not benefiting from it as much as they could, due to pervasive stigmas surrounding mental health within these communities. While more resources are available now, due to cultural differences and language barriers, much can get lost in translation.\n\nImproving individual mental health can often involve support from the whole family. While this experience is not intended to replace therapy or professional help, it is geared toward helping individuals learn, discuss, connect, and reflect on their mental health with their families over time. Inspired by the success of popular discussion card games like “We’re Not Really Strangers,” Table Talk utilizes a series of prompts that recontextualize mental health concepts into questions and ideas that help broach the cultural barrier or generation gap that many Asian American families struggle with. Table Talk incorporates a variety of different strategies to help start the conversation on mental health in a gentle and inclusive way.",

        "Inspiration: This project is inspired by a dutch artist Berndnaut Smilde’s project Clouds and Chris Luka's work. Its ephemeral interpretation made me think of using transparent paper to interpret everyone's fleeting expressions.\nMain: I superimposed twenty portraits to express the different emotions of each moment, using my own portrait as the base plate, and adding my own mosaic art or hand-painting on the base plate to show my anxiety about myself Psychological redemption.\nPeople's anxiety will change due to time, place and surrounding environment including surrounding people, so I choose to present this work in this way. This is an installation art that looks different from every angle, and aims to show that everyone can get their own different opinions when looking at this work from different angles.\nOutcome: The combination of projection and print is used to show the perfect visual effect, and the superposition of transparent paper is used to show people's different instant expressions.",

I set out on this mission to create FurnishStore coming from the mindset of a to-be apartment owner. In my search for an apartment, I realized that finding furniture while still retaining a certain style is an issue for apartment owners. There aren't many choices available—either you go to Ikea or you don't—and this situation limits people's personal choice in creating their own aesthetic for their living spaces. FurnishStore is the alternative choice for people who aim to be able to find local furniture while still building out their own aesthetics and styles for their place.",

I want to explore the different parts of people’s identities that form as a result of leaving home and moving away from their families. The themes that I would like to explore with this project are related to identity, self-discovery, leaving home, culture and family. \nThe project will take form in two walls with four windows. A total of four different videos will be played at the same time and projected on the windows. One of the windows will contain interviews I filmed with five international students including myself. Next to the interviews I wanted to show pictures that show images and videos of the interviewee’s family and home. The second wall will show a 3D model of an object that has a resemblance to interviewees’ memories of their childhood, the place they grew up in as well as objects that represent their current lives. Next to this window will be another window showing videos of them or their families interacting with this object.",

I was inspired by my talks tutoring 3rd graders and asking them about their favorite things.  I created this animation to appeal to kids under 12 to inspire a sense of curiosity and wonder and yet an underlying message of caution.",

        "Initially, my project started off as the 100 Day Daily UI Challenge, with the initial intention of building my UI Portfolio. My project had a major pivot when I started realizing that I was feeling unfulfilled with the project as it stood - I felt as though the challenge wasn't challenging me enough, and especially as someone that was taught UX fundamentals, I began seeing the UI challenge through a UX lens, noticing many things that the UI challenge lacked. From there, my intention was simply to create my own UX challenge based on the Daily UI challenge, but I quickly realized that UX is far more complex than UI in terms of how iteration happens and the thought that goes into each design decision. Through my entire project process, I was able to study my own thoughts and behavior to understand how exactly UI and UX are distinct - and why my initial idea of creating the \"Daily UX Challenge\" wouldn't have worked out.",

I hope that they find comfort and validation in what they feel and what they go through. The main component of this zine are the interviews with 3 South Asian women whom give amazing insight into our struggles and joys.",

I have been working on a biodegradable ceramic bottle fabricated with the help of the bacteria S. pasteurii. This bottle would be dispensed in solar powered vending machines at parks and campsites, and could be returned to the machine for a credit towards another purchase. The bottles could be ground up and remolded or sterilized and refilled inside of the machine. If the bottles ended up being left at the campsite or trail as litter, they would break down into calcium particles. Further steps would be to investigate how the bottles could be seed bombs that are activated by fire and improve the area that they are left in.",
