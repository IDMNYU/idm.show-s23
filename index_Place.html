            <h2>About IDM</h2>
            <p>The Integrated Design & Media Program is a place that fosters creative practice, design research and
              multidisciplinary experimentation with emerging media technologies. IDM is a ‘STEAM‘ program combining
              artistic inquiry with scientific research and technological practice to explore the social, cultural and
              ethical potentials of emerging technologies. We focus on how to create new experiences with technologies
              but
              also on what is worth making and why.<br>
              In our academic programs, digital media is explored as a spectrum of practices that range from computer
              programming (for app development, software engineering, game development and interaction design) to 2D and
              3D
              graphics (for human-computer interfaces, augmented reality, motion capture, and game design & development)
              to
              photography, film, and audio (for media installations, performing arts research, and integration with
              various
              mediums). Our students are artists, designers, and creative technologists working in highly fluid
              industries
              that reward the creative, the thoughtful, the technical, and the innovative.<br>
              Masks are optional, but strongly encouraged.
